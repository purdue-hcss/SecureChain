# ⛓️ SecureChain: A Knowledge Graph for Software Supply Chain Security

Welcome to the **SecureChain** project! This repository contains the tools and scripts to build a comprehensive knowledge graph for tracking dependencies, vulnerabilities, and other critical information across the software supply chain.

## 🚀 TL;DR

**SecureChain** is a project that builds a cross-ecosystem knowledge graph (KG) of **software, hardware, and known vulnerabilities (CVE/CWE)**, linking versions, dependency edges, vendors, and advisories across sources such as ConanCenter, Debian, GitHub, deps.dev, NVD (CVE), CPE, Wikipedia/DBpedia lookups, and curated vendor info.

* **Ontology:** [Secure Chain Ontology](https://purdue-hcss.github.io/secure-chain-ontology/) (`sc:` → `https://w3id.org/secure-chain/`, extends `schema.org`)

## 🔗 What is the Software Supply Chain?

Software has become an integral part of crucial infrastructures throughout the United States. Underlying modern software systems is the supply chain of open-source software components, such as Apache Spark, whose functionalities are reused and integrated into various systems underpinning modern society.

## ⚠️ Risks in Software Supply Chains

While software supply chains empower the rapid development of software systems, they also increase the risks, since any bugs, vulnerabilities, and unauthorized changes in upstream components can propagate to downstream systems and cause severe consequences. This is evident through many software crises witnessed in recent years, such as the [Heartbleed bug](https://heartbleed.com/), the [Equifax data breach](https://www.securityweek.com/equifax-confirms-apache-struts-flaw-used-hack/#:~:text=U.S.%20credit%20reporting%20agency%20Equifax,used%20to%20breach%20its%20systems.), and the [NPM left-pad incident](https://qz.com/646467/how-one-programmer-broke-the-internet-by-deleting-a-tiny-piece-of-code) that almost broke the Internet.

## ✅ Our Solution

> Develop a unified knowledge graph to continually collect and track software dependency and vulnerabilities discussed in various online documents. 🔮

In this project, our team aims to develop a unified knowledge graph that captures rich, up-to-date information about software components in heterogeneous software ecosystems. The resulting knowledge graph will empower us to further develop a novel multi-modal query interface for knowledge dissemination, as well as new risk mitigation approaches that perform deep scans on software systems, detect potential risks, and automatically repair them.

The figure below demonstrates an example knowledge graph for software supply chain security, where each entity—such as a software library or a vulnerability—is represented as a node, and the relations between them are depicted as edges.

## ⛓️ Secure Chain

**SecureChain** is a project that builds a cross-ecosystem knowledge graph (KG) of **software, hardware, and known vulnerabilities (CVE/CWE)**, linking versions, dependency edges, vendors, and advisories across sources such as ConanCenter, Debian, GitHub, deps.dev, NVD (CVE), CPE, Wikipedia/DBpedia lookups, and curated vendor info.

The knowledge graph canonically uses the namespace `https://w3id.org/secure-chain/` and extends `schema.org` with a small set of classes & properties for supply-chain security.
